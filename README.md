# Inventory QR
 

## Description
This repo provides tools to help businesses manage inventory using QR codes. 

## Installation
You will need to create a dotenv file to set which type of input device you will be scanning QR codes with (i.e. 'Camera' or 'Scanner'). The file should be named `.env` and should look something like this: 
```
# Input type 'Scanner' or 'Camera' are the only options
INPUT_TYPE = 'Camera'
```
